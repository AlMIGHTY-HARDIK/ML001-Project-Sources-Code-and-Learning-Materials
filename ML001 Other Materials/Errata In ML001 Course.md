# Errata In ML001 Course  

In ML001, Instructor had made some mistakes while writing formulas, so all the erata in this course can be found here. 

1.) Errata in **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**:- 

Instructor haven't found any Errata in this Section, If you find one plz feel free to make a PR. 

2.) Errata in **Linear Regression**:-  

__Errata 1:__ TimeStamp : 57:15  

While taking out the partial deriviative of our cost function, Ayush derived this value :- $\frac{2}{m} +  \sum  \limits _{i = 1} ^{m} (\Theta^{T}x^{i} - y^{i})^{2}$ but instead of this it should be $\frac{2}{m} *  \sum  \limits _{i = 1} ^{m} (\Theta^{T}x^{i} - y^{i})^{2}$. 

2.) Errata in **Logistic Regression**:- 

Instructor haven’t found any Errata in this Section, If you find one plz feel free to make a PR.

3.) Errata in **Regularization**:- 

Instructor haven’t found any Errata in this Section, If you find one plz feel free to make a PR. 


4.) Errata for further sections can be added here. 

Some Points while adding Errata:-  

- Please Include the timestamps including the section name and correct that errata.  
- If you find anything which can be explained better, do email me, I will make another video on the same topic on [Newera](https://youtube.com/c/neweraa).
